# ekg-analysis

We've gathered data from multiple people who we've asked to read and interpret EKGs using Tobii eye tracker.

Analysing the data outputed by Tobii eye tracking software, this project tries to understand whether there is a change in the visual behaviour of participants that might indicate they have reached a decision regarding the interpretation of the ECG, as opposed to making a summative sweep of the image to exclude any additional pathology.
